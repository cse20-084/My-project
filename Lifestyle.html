            Life is about taking a leap of faith, and sometimes it's about taking that leap from 13,500 feet with your legs dangling precariously from the edge of an aircraft. If you’re looking for an adrenalin rush, and an exceptional sense of accomplishment, nothing beats skydiving.
             Nothing you do will ever thrill you like the experience of skydiving and chances are, you would immediately want to do it all over again. For Indians, skydiving in Dubai is probably the best way to experience Dubai’s flamboyant sights.
             Important things you need to know about skydiving in Dubai is that,those who wish to go sky diving in Dubai, must be above 18 years of age,must weigh below 100kg for safety reasons and are required to sign a liability waiver form that lists out the risks involved in the process of sky diving
             Weather plays an important role in the success of a dive, so bad weather may lengthen the time taken for the entire activity. On a good day, you'll have to spare at least three hours for the entire diving experience
