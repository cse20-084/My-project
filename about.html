              <h1 style="text-transform: uppercase; text-align: center;">Dubai  Culture and Language</h1>
          <p>
              The history and culture of Dubai is deeply rooted in Islamic traditions that shape a UAE national's lifestyle. It is important to note that when tourists visit Dubai they must respect the culture and behave accordingly, as minority groups in the Emiratis are very protective of their Islamic culture and traditions.
              Dubai is famously known as the entertainment capital of the Middle East which attracts many party lovers from all over the world, especially those who are wealthy enough to splurge on the most expensive places in the city. 
              While Dubai has cultivated this image for its tourists, it still discourages its Islamic nationals to indulge in many of the entertainment services offered. Hence, these services are often located in the more touristy areas rather than in residential parts
              is not forbidden in Dubai, as long as it is confined within the designated areas in hotels, bars or nightclubs. Residents are free to drink in their own homes as long as they have an alcohol licence issued by the municipality. It is illegal to drink in the street or in other public places. Pork is also available for the consumption of visitors and expatriates.
              It is advised that visitors and expatriates do not flaunt their Western culture habits in the streets, where they can be viewed by conservative nationals who may find it offensive.
              Having said this, it does not mean the locals are against foreigners visiting Dubai, it is just common courtesy to respect your hosts. Emiratis are traditionally known for their warm hospitality and they are very generous when offering refreshments to guests. Remember, when in Rome, do as Romans do.

           <p style="margin-top:20px;"> 
            The official language of the country is Arabic, however most people in and out of the workplace communicate in English. There are so many different nationalities in Dubai and therefore English finds common ground with most people. 
            The majority of road, shop signs, and restaurant menus etc. are in both English and Arabic.

          <h1 style="text-transform: uppercase; text-align: center;">Religion</h1>
          <p>
             Dubai, like the rest of the UAE is an Islamic Emirate and once in the city you are surrounded by many mosques and the call of prayer will be heard frequently. The most religious time of the year in Dubai is the Holy Month of Ramadan, which lasts for approximately 30 days. This is when Muslims fast during daylight hours to fulfil their duties to the fourth pillar of Islam.
             Tourists must be aware that during this period, eating, drinking and smoking is not permitted in public during the day, although some restaurants blackout their windows to allow people to consume food and beverages in private. Bars will not serve alcohol before 7.00pm and nightclubs are shut as no loud music is allowed.
             
             However, the UAE is tolerant and welcoming to foreigners who do not practice Islam. The government follows a policy of tolerance towards non-Muslims and Polytheist and in practice, interferes very little with their religious activities. The huge Arab population in Dubai includes many from Middle-Eastern countries which follow the Christian faith and non-Muslim expatriates.
              They are freely allowed to practice their own religion as long as they do not publicly distribute literature. In fact, Dubai has other religious places of worship, such as churches, gurdwaras and temples. The Meena Bazaar area of the city has both a Shiva and Krishna temple. Both are believed to be sanctioned by the late ruler of Dubai, Sheikh Rashid Bin Saeed Al Maktoum.
