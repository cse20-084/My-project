        Experience the safari in the morning! For people who are short on time or have busy evenings should try the morning safari for adventure and Dune bashing. A car will pick you up in the morning around 9 AM and take you straight to the desert. Here you will enjoy 20 minutes of awesome dune bashing with experienced drivers and then head back to camp. At the camp you
        also have options to try quad biking, camel rides and sand skiing. Water and soft drinks are complimentary at the camp. Thereafter the car drops you to your hotel. The whole experience takes approximately 2 hours.
        A must for everyone who is visiting UAE. A memory to share with your family and friends back home, this is one safari you can’t do back home. We recommend it highly and it will be worth every penny spent!
       The Evening tour starts in the afternoon across the desert of Dubai with several stops for photography. During an exciting dune drive you arrive at the first destination for a beautiful sunset. They stop to watch the sunset and continue with Dune bashing to finally reach the campsite. Here you have the opportunity to do a camel ride, sand boarding and try out a henna design on hand or feet. After working up an appetite you get to enjoy a delicious barbecue dinner and shisha (the famous Arabic water pipe).
       You also get to enjoy our Fire show and Tanura show performance around the campfire by starlight.
